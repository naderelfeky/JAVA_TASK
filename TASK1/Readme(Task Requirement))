Design a class named Time. This class contains:
■ The data fields hour, minute, and second that represent a time.
■ A no-arg constructor that creates a Time object for the current time. (The values
of the data fields will represent the current time.)
■ A constructor that constructs a Time object with a specified elapsed time since
midnight, January 1, 1970, in milliseconds. (The values of the data fields will
represent this time.)
■ A constructor that constructs a Time object with the specified hour, minute, and
second.
■ Three get methods for the data fields hour, minute, and second, respectively.
■ A method named setTime(long elapseTime) that sets a new time for the
object using the elapsed time. For example, if the elapsed time is 555550000
milliseconds, the hour is 10, the minute is 19, and the second is 10.
