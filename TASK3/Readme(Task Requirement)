Design a class named MyPoint to represent a point with xand y-coordinates. The class contains:
■ The data fields x and y that represent the coordinates with get methods.
■ A no-arg constructor that creates a point (0, 0).
■ A constructor that constructs a point with specified coordinates.
■ Two get methods for the data fields x and y, respectively.
■ A method named distance that returns the distance from this point to another
point of the MyPoint type.
■ A method named distance that returns the distance from this point to another
point with specified x- and y-coordinates.
